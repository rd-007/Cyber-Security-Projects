# IoT Device Vulnerability Scanner

Local-only tool that discovers devices on a subnet, fingerprints them, matches against offline CVE data, and outputs a per-device risk report.

Components:
1. `scannerlib` – discovery, fingerprinting, CVE matcher
2. CLI – quick scans via Typer/Rich
3. REST API – FastAPI
4. (Optional) Dashboard – static report UI

All functionality works fully offline once the CVE feed is downloaded.
